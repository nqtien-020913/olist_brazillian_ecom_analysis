# OLIST BRAZILLIAN ECOMMERCE ANALYSIS

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Context
Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces, generously provided this dataset. Olist connects small businesses across Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants can sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on the website: www.olist.com

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

### 1.2. Situation
In the rapidly growing landscape of e-commerce, data plays a crucial role in helping businesses understand customer behavior, streamline operations, and improve overall performance. However, many companies still face challenges in **leveraging data effectively** to enhance customer experience, optimize supply chains, and make informed, data-driven strategic decisions.

### 1.3. Objective
This project focuses on **three key objectives**:

1. **Operational Performance Analysis** â€“ Evaluate sales performance, delivery processes, and customer satisfaction to propose actionable improvements.
2. **Customer Behavior Analysis** â€“ Identify potential customer segments, uncover shopping patterns, and explore factors influencing purchase decisions.
3. **Predictive Analytics** â€“ Apply data models to forecast sales and support businesses in developing more effective strategies.

By leveraging data holistically, businesses can make smarter decisions, optimize resources, and maintain a strong competitive edge. ðŸš€
